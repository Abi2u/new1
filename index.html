   <p>Winston Churchill was an inspirational leader who led Britain to victory 
     in the Second World War. He served as Conservative Prime Minister twice - from 1940 to 1945 
      before being defeated in the 1945 general election </p>

    <p> He faced so many challenges during his life-time including severe mental illness and many political defeats but was 
    able to overcome through persistence. His famous words “never give in, never give in, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, 
    large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense....” has been a inspiration to many individuals and organisations.
